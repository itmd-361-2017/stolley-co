      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Professor Stolley. I'm starting my, um, 11th year as faculty at IIT.
        I'm faculty in both the <a href="https://appliedtech.iit.edu/information-technology-and-management">ITM</a> and Humanities departments, and I teach
        mostly web development courses. I've written a book on web design, which
        is now in its second edition, although we won't be using that in this
        class (it's written for a less technical audience than you'd find in
        ITM).
      </p>
      <p class="details">
        I live on the northwest side of the city, in the Logan Square
        neighborhood. I love the outdoors, whether its working in my yard or
        hanging out on the patio with my dog, Hank. Speaking of Hank, he's the
        best:
